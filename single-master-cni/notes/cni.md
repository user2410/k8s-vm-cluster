Based on the configuration files you provided, the Kubernetes cluster is using a **basic bridge-based CNI plugin** configuration. Here's the breakdown:

---

### 🔍 Key Indicators:

#### `/etc/cni/net.d/10-bridge.conf`

* `"type": "bridge"`
  ➤ This indicates that the **CNI plugin in use is `bridge`**, which is one of the **reference CNI plugins** maintained by the [containernetworking team](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins).

* `"bridge": "cni0"`
  ➤ The plugin creates a Linux bridge named `cni0`.

* `"ipam": { "type": "host-local" ... }`
  ➤ This shows it's using the **host-local IP Address Management** plugin for assigning IPs from a local pool (`10.96.1.0/24`).

---

#### `/etc/cni/net.d/99-loopback.conf`

* `"type": "loopback"`
  ➤ This is a standard loopback interface required by all CNI configurations. Every pod needs one, regardless of the main CNI.

---

### ✅ Conclusion:

The cluster is using the **reference CNI plugins**:

* `bridge` for networking
* `host-local` for IPAM
* `loopback` for loopback interface

---

### ❗️This is *not* a production-grade CNI like:

* Calico
* Flannel
* Cilium
* Weave

Those CNIs often use `"type"` values like `calico`, `flannel`, or `cilium`, and include more advanced configurations such as BGP, VXLAN overlays, or policy engines. You're using a **basic, static configuration**—suitable for **testing or minimal environments**.


## 🛠 Reference CNI Plugins: Purpose and Design

The **reference CNI plugins** (like `bridge`, `host-local`, `loopback`) are **meant as simple, functional examples**, primarily for:

* Testing CNI compatibility
* Local development
* Bootstrapping environments
* Learning purposes

They are part of the [CNI plugin reference implementation](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins) and maintained mainly for conformance and demonstration.

---

## 🚫 Why They’re Not Production-Grade

Here are the key limitations:

### 1. **No Cross-Node Networking**

* The `bridge` plugin only sets up networking **within the same node**.
* Pods on one node **cannot reach** pods on another node — a non-starter for most real-world clusters.

> 📌 Production CNIs like Calico, Flannel, and Cilium solve this using overlays (e.g., VXLAN), routing (e.g., BGP), or other distributed networking mechanisms.

---

### 2. **No Network Policies or Security Features**

* The `bridge` plugin does **not support Kubernetes NetworkPolicy**, which means:

  * You cannot enforce security boundaries between pods.
  * There's no control over ingress/egress traffic.

> 🛡️ CNIs like Calico and Cilium offer rich policy enforcement for both L3 and L7 traffic.

---

### 3. **Limited IP Management**

* `host-local` IPAM gives IPs from a **static local range**.
* No coordination between nodes → IP conflicts are possible in a multi-node setup.

> 🔄 Production CNIs handle **dynamic, cluster-wide IPAM** and avoid such conflicts.

---

### 4. **No Support for Advanced Features**

* No encryption, service load-balancing, observability, or eBPF acceleration.
* No integration with cloud-native networking (like AWS VPC CNI, Azure CNI, etc.)

---

### 5. **Minimal Fault Tolerance and Monitoring**

* No built-in metrics, logging, or health checks.
* No integration with Prometheus, Grafana, etc.
* Not resilient to failures or node churn.

## ✅ Summary

| Feature                        | `bridge` + `host-local` | Production CNI (e.g. Calico, Cilium) |

| Cross-node pod networking      | ❌                       | ✅                                    |
| NetworkPolicy support          | ❌                       | ✅                                    |
| Cluster-wide IPAM              | ❌                       | ✅                                    |

## 🧪 When Is `bridge` CNI Useful?

* Single-node development/testing clusters (like Minikube, kind, or kubeadm testbeds)
* Validating CNI plugin installation logic
* Debugging CNI-level networking in isolated environments
